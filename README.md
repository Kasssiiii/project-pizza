# Project Name

This is my first JavaScripy project. The aim is to built a bot that will assist with ordering pizza.

## The problem

Once I understood the scope of the project, I also reviewed course maerials for this Unit. Then, I focused on decideding what variables, data types, conditionals and operators to use. Next, I decided to structure my code around the comments, which I put in first.
